# Tries-Implementation
Tries area special kind of Trees where in the root child is left empty and it can have multiple children nodes. Each Child can have several nodes 
- Auto completion is one of the key applications in tries 
- Tries allow us to store thousands and millions of words in minimal space, affording us fast look ups 

This code's aim is to demonstrate how Tries can be used to inplement auto completion. 
All the methods in here are instrumental to this aim and are pretty much explanatory, I added notes om each method so it's like reading a manual, enjoy.
